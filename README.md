ESG Case Study: Mapping Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in Groundwater Using GIS

This repository contains the data and GIS project files from a real-world case study conducted near the industrial zone of Pančevo, Serbia.

🌍 Project Summary

We analyzed groundwater samples using piezometer data and visualized pollution patterns using QGIS. The goal was to detect signs of Scope 3 environmental impact, specifically hydrocarbon contamination resulting from upstream transportation activities (not direct operations).

 🔬 Focus Parameter
- Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH)** – simulated values based on real sampling points

📌 Key Findings
- Pollution hotspots aligned with supplier transit routes
- Persistence across seasons suggests systemic discharge
- Relevant to Scope 3 ESG disclosures

📁 What’s Included
- `TPH_GIS_Points.csv` – sampling locations with synthetic TPH concentrations
- `groundwater_scope3.qgz` – QGIS project file for spatial interpolation
- `/output/TPH_map.png` – rendered hotspot map (optional PDF version)
- `README.md` – this file

 🛠 How to Use
1. Download this repository as a ZIP or clone it.
2. Open `groundwater_scope3.qgz` in [QGIS](https://qgis.org).
3. Adjust layer symbology or run IDW interpolation if not already applied.

 📈 ESG Relevance
This project demonstrates how spatial analysis can uncover hidden environmental risks tied to supply chains—often missed in traditional reporting frameworks.
